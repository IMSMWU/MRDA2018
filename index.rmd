# Welcome! {-}

This is an introduction to statistics using the statistical software R presented by the Institute for Interactive Marketing and Social Media at WU Vienna.<br>

```{r, out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}

The tutorial is intended to facilitate the learning process by summarizing the content that was covered in class. It includes the code files that we used during each session, along with the commented outputs and explanations in text and video format. You can use it as a reference for this course but also for other courses that you will take throughout your studies.  
<br>
None of the material on the following pages is new, nor is it invented by us. We intend to provide a summary of existing material interesting to the marketing researcher. We have cited the sources used for all the tutorials. However, if we have not given you appropriate credit for your work or failed to cite something correctly please [contact us through the github page of this course](https://github.com/IMSMWU/MRDA2018/issues) so we can resolve the issue amicably.

In addition to the main readings, there are many excellent books available (many of them for free) that focus on different aspects of R. In case you would like to learn more about the capabilities of R, I can recommend the following books:

* __"[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)"__ An excellent book by Hadley Wickham, which introduces you to R as a tool for doing data science, focussing on a consistent set of packages known as the tidyverse. [FREE online version]

* __"[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)"__ This book provides an introduction to statistical learning methods and covers basic methods (e.g., linear regression) as well as more advanced methods (e.g., Support Vector Machines). [FREE online version]

* __"[R for Marketing Research and Analytics](http://r-marketing.r-forge.r-project.org/)"__ A great book that is designed to teach R to marketing practitioners and data scientists.

* __"[Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com/)"__ This book explains how you can analyse unstrunctured data (texts) using R. [FREE online version]

* __"[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)"__ another great book written by Hadley Wickham. Explains more advanced R concepts. [FREE online version]

* __"[Using R For Introductory Econometrics](http://www.urfie.net/read/mobile/index.html#p=1)"__ This book covers a nice introduction to R with a focus on the implementation of standard tools and methods used in econometrics. [FREE online version]

* __"[R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)"__ which teaches you how to make the most of R's fantastic package system. [FREE online version]

* __"[More books](http://ucanalytics.com/blogs/learn-r-12-books-and-online-resources/)"__ For more recommendations, please refer to this list of excellent books on specific topics related to R

Please also make use of the abundance of web resources. For students who would like to further train the materials covered in class, we recommend DataCamp, an online platform that offers interactive courses in data science at different levels. To facilitate the learning process you will obtain full access to the entire DataCamp course curriculum for the duration of the course.
